# Domain Entity UUIDv4 IDs

## Goal

Represent domain entity identifiers with UUIDv4.

When the programming language or standard library provides a built-in UUID type, prefer that type for domain entity IDs. When no such built-in type exists, use `string` for domain entity IDs and keep UUIDv4 generation and validation explicit.

Treat this standard as identity-format guidance for domain entities. It determines the identifier format (UUIDv4) and the underlying type (built-in UUID or `string`). Whether to wrap that underlying type in a distinct type per domain entity — such as `OrderId` or `CustomerId` — is a separate concern handled by the [Domain Entity Typed IDs](domain-entity-typed-ids.md) standard.

The key question is whether the edited code defines, carries, validates, stores, serializes, or exposes the identifier of a domain entity.

## What Counts as In Scope

Apply this standard to code that does one or more of these things:

- defines the ID field or property of a domain entity
- defines constructor parameters or factory inputs for domain entity identity
- defines the type used to carry a domain entity ID through the domain model
- parses, validates, serializes, or deserializes domain entity IDs
- maps domain entity IDs to persistence, transport, or integration boundaries
- creates new domain entity IDs
- compares or stores identity values used to distinguish one entity from another

## UUIDv4 Rule

1. Use UUIDv4 for every domain entity identifier touched by the task.
   - Preserve UUIDv4 semantics across in-memory representation, persistence mappings, and exchanged payloads.
   - Do not weaken the identifier representation to an unconstrained string when a built-in UUID type exists.

2. Prefer the language's built-in UUID type when available.
   - Use the native or standard-library UUID type directly when the language makes it available and the project conventions allow it.
   - Do not fall back to `string` when a built-in UUID type exists.

3. When no built-in UUID type exists, use `string`.
   - Use `string` as the underlying identifier type.
   - Keep generation, parsing, and validation explicit enough that UUIDv4 remains the enforced format.
   - This rule determines the underlying type only. Whether to wrap it in a typed ID such as `OrderId` is determined by the [Domain Entity Typed IDs](domain-entity-typed-ids.md) standard.

## Detection Workflow

1. Find the identity boundary first.
   - Locate the fields, properties, constructor arguments, factory inputs, or persistence mappings that represent domain entity identity.
   - Check whether the identifier appears in domain code, serialization code, persistence code, or communication contracts.

2. Detect UUID type support in the stack.
   - Identify whether the language or standard library offers a UUID type.
   - Follow the project's established conventions for importing, constructing, and storing that type.

3. Trace generation and conversion points.
   - Identify where new IDs are created.
   - Identify where IDs are parsed from text, converted for storage, or emitted across boundaries.
   - Verify that UUIDv4 remains the enforced format at each point.

## Writing or Changing Domain Entity IDs

1. Keep UUIDv4 explicit in the model.
   - Name ID fields and parameters clearly.
   - Use the built-in UUID type when available, otherwise use `string`.

2. Prefer native UUID handling over ad hoc strings.
   - Use the built-in UUID type when available instead of representing IDs as generic text.
   - Keep conversions at boundaries small and explicit.

3. Use `string` when the language has no built-in UUID type.
   - Keep the UUIDv4 contract explicit at parsing, validation, serialization, and generation points.
   - This determines the underlying type. Whether to wrap it in a typed ID is a separate concern.

4. Preserve identity consistency end to end.
   - Verify that the same UUIDv4 value can move through constructors, domain methods, persistence mappings, serializers, and external contracts without losing meaning.
   - Verify that new IDs are generated as UUIDv4, not merely accepted in that format.

5. Keep validation close to parsing or construction.
   - Reject malformed or non-UUIDv4 inputs when IDs enter the system as text or external data.
   - Make the valid construction path obvious in the code.

## Review Questions

When reading or reviewing code, ask:

- Is this code defining or carrying the identity of a domain entity?
- Is that identity represented as UUIDv4?
- Does the stack provide a built-in UUID type that should be used here?
- If not, is the identity represented as `string` with explicit UUIDv4 handling?
- Where is UUIDv4 generated, parsed, validated, stored, or serialized?
- Would changing this code risk weakening the UUIDv4 guarantee for domain entity identity?

If the answer is yes, apply this standard.

## Report the Outcome

When finishing the task:

- state which domain entity IDs were identified or changed
- state whether a built-in UUID type or `string` was used, and why
- state where UUIDv4 generation, parsing, validation, or conversion was implemented or preserved
