# Ensure Authenticated Requester for Business Logic Entry Points

## Goal

Every business-logic entry point that requires authentication must include an `ensure requester is authenticated` business constraint as the first check before any other business logic runs.

This constraint follows the `ensure ...` formalism. Restate the rule as:

- `ensure requester is authenticated`

Translate that formulation into the syntax, naming, and control-flow conventions of the language in use.

On success this constraint returns the requester id so that downstream business logic can use it directly without re-extracting it from the input. On failure it returns an error indicating that the requester is not authenticated.

## What Counts as In Scope

Apply this standard to code that does one or more of these things:

- defines a business-logic entry point that must only run for authenticated requesters
- checks whether the incoming request originates from an authenticated identity before executing business logic
- protects a business operation from unauthenticated execution
- extracts authentication verification logic into a helper, method, or validator inside business logic

## Relationship to the Ensure Business Constraints Standard

This standard is a specialization of the general [Ensure Business Constraints for Business Logic](business-logic-ensure-business-constraints.md) standard. All rules in that standard apply here except for the success return value. This standard adds specificity about what the constraint checks, where it must appear, and what it returns:

- The constraint is always `ensure requester is authenticated`.
- The constraint must be the first business constraint checked at the entry point, before any other business constraints run.
- The constraint verifies identity authentication, not authorization, permissions, roles, or eligibility.
- Unlike general business constraints that return a unit-equivalent value on success, this constraint returns the requester id on success to facilitate downstream business logic.

## Ensure Rule

1. Restate the constraint as `ensure requester is authenticated` before writing code.
   - This is the single business rule this constraint enforces.
   - Use that formulation to decide the final method name, predicate, branch, or helper shape in code.

2. Translate the rule into the local language convention.
   - Use the project's naming style, such as camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase, or an idiomatic statement form.
   - Prefer explicit names such as `ensureRequesterIsAuthenticated`, `ensure_requester_is_authenticated`, or the closest local equivalent.
   - Keep the code shape idiomatic for the language rather than forcing foreign syntax.

3. Place this constraint first at every entry point that requires authentication.
   - Before any other business constraint, business rule, or business operation.
   - The entry point must not proceed to any business logic if this constraint fails.

4. The constraint returns the requester id on success.
   - Return the requester id so that subsequent business logic can use it directly.
   - Do not return full user objects, tokens, sessions, or other identity details beyond the requester id.

5. The constraint fails with an error when the requester is not authenticated.
   - Use the project's error convention, such as an error value, thrown domain error, result error, or equivalent failure construct.
   - Make the error correspond to the specific violation: unauthenticated request.

6. Keep the constraint focused on authentication only.
   - Do not mix authorization, permissions, roles, or eligibility checks into this constraint.
   - Use separate `ensure ...` constraints for those concerns.

## Input Convention

The authentication constraint needs to receive the requester's authentication information.

When the project follows [Execution Context for Business Logic Entry Points](business-logic-entry-point-execution-context.md), the command or query type does not need to carry the requester identity — `runWithinContext` resolves it internally when creating the context. The constraint retrieves the requester identity from the execution context instead of receiving it as a parameter.

When the project does not follow that standard, the command or query type at the entry point should include the requester identity or authentication token as a field. The constraint receives that field and verifies it represents an authenticated requester. Do not reach outside the entry point's input to obtain authentication state.

## Detection Workflow

1. Find business-logic entry points first.
   - Identify command handlers, query handlers, and other business-logic entry points.
   - Determine which entry points must only run for authenticated requesters.

2. Check for the presence of the authentication constraint.
   - Look for an `ensure requester is authenticated` check or its local equivalent.
   - Verify that it is the first constraint checked at the entry point.

3. Check the constraint shape.
   - Verify that success returns the requester id.
   - Verify that failure produces an error indicating the requester is not authenticated.

4. Check the constraint focus.
   - Verify that the authentication constraint does not also check authorization, permissions, roles, or other concerns.
   - Those checks should be separate `ensure ...` constraints if needed.

5. Prefer semantic classification to syntax alone.
   - Do not classify a check as the authentication constraint only because it appears first.
   - Classify it by whether it verifies that the requester is authenticated.

## Writing or Changing the Authentication Constraint

1. Name the constraint from the business rule.
   - Start from the `ensure requester is authenticated` formulation.
   - Translate it into the local naming convention.

2. Place it as the first constraint at the entry point.
   - Before any other `ensure ...` constraint.
   - Before any business operation or data access.

3. Return the requester id on success.
   - Return the requester id so downstream logic can use it without re-extracting it from the input.
   - Do not return full user objects, tokens, session data, or other identity details beyond the requester id.

4. Return or raise a meaningful error on failure.
   - Use an error type or error value that explains that the requester is not authenticated.
   - Avoid vague failure shapes when the local style supports explicit errors.

5. Keep the constraint direct and readable.
   - Prefer a straightforward check and early failure path.
   - Avoid burying the authentication check behind unrelated branching or side effects.

## Examples

TypeScript with execution context and neverthrow:

```ts
function ensureRequesterIsAuthenticated(): ResultAsync<
  RequesterId,
  RequesterIsNotAuthenticated
> {
  const ctx = getExecutionContext();
  const requesterId = ctx?.requesterId ?? null;

  if (!requesterId) {
    return errAsync(new RequesterIsNotAuthenticated());
  }

  return okAsync(requesterId as RequesterId);
}

function createReservationCommandHandler(
  command: CreateReservationCommand,
): ResultAsync<CreateReservationCommandHandlerSuccess, CreateReservationCommandHandlerError> {
  return ensureRequesterIsAuthenticated()
    .andThen((requesterId) => {
      // other business constraints and business logic using requesterId
    })
}
```

TypeScript with neverthrow (explicit passing, for languages without execution context):

```ts
function ensureRequesterIsAuthenticated(
  requesterId: RequesterId,
): ResultAsync<RequesterId, RequesterIsNotAuthenticated> {
  // verify the requester is authenticated, return the requesterId on success
}

function createReservationCommandHandler(
  command: CreateReservationCommand,
): ResultAsync<CreateReservationCommandHandlerSuccess, CreateReservationCommandHandlerError> {
  return ensureRequesterIsAuthenticated(command.requesterId)
    .andThen((requesterId) => {
      // other business constraints and business logic using requesterId
    })
}
```

TypeScript with exceptions (explicit passing, for languages without execution context):

```ts
function ensureRequesterIsAuthenticated(
  requesterId: RequesterId,
): Promise<RequesterId> {
  // verify the requester is authenticated, throw RequesterIsNotAuthenticated if not
  // return the requesterId on success
}

async function createReservationCommandHandler(
  command: CreateReservationCommand,
): Promise<CreateReservationCommandHandlerSuccess> {
  const requesterId = await ensureRequesterIsAuthenticated(command.requesterId)
  // other business constraints and business logic using requesterId
}
```

Python:

```py
def ensure_requester_is_authenticated(
    requester_id: RequesterId,
) -> RequesterId:
    # verify the requester is authenticated, raise RequesterIsNotAuthenticated if not
    # return the requester_id on success
    ...

def create_reservation_command_handler(
    command: CreateReservationCommand,
) -> CreateReservationCommandHandlerSuccess:
    requester_id = ensure_requester_is_authenticated(command.requester_id)
    # other business constraints and business logic using requester_id
```

Kotlin:

```kt
fun ensureRequesterIsAuthenticated(
    requesterId: RequesterId,
): RequesterId {
    // verify the requester is authenticated, throw RequesterIsNotAuthenticated if not
    // return the requesterId on success
}

fun createReservationCommandHandler(
    command: CreateReservationCommand,
): CreateReservationCommandHandlerSuccess {
    val requesterId = ensureRequesterIsAuthenticated(command.requesterId)
    // other business constraints and business logic using requesterId
}
```

## Review Questions

When reading or reviewing code, ask:

- Does this entry point require an authenticated requester?
- Is there an `ensure requester is authenticated` constraint or its local equivalent?
- Is it the first constraint checked, before any other business constraint or business logic?
- Does it return the requester id on success?
- Does it produce an error when the requester is not authenticated?
- Does it avoid mixing in authorization, permissions, or role checks?
- Does the entry point receive the requester's authentication information through its declared input parameter?

If the answer is yes, apply this standard.

## Report the Outcome

When finishing the task:

- state which entry points were identified or changed
- state where the `ensure requester is authenticated` constraint was added or verified
- state how the constraint was translated into the local language convention
- state that the constraint returns the requester id on success and which failure error shape was used
- state that the constraint is placed before any other business constraint at the entry point
