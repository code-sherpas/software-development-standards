# Primitive Input Types for Business Logic Entry Points

## Goal

The fields of command and query types accepted by business-logic entry points must use only primitive or basic types.

A business-logic entry point receives raw input data and is responsible for constructing, loading, or looking up domain entities internally. The caller must never be required to build a domain entity before calling the entry point.

Do not use domain-entity types, domain aggregate types, value objects with behavior, or other complex domain objects as fields in command or query types.

## What Counts as In Scope

Apply this standard to code that does one or more of these things:

- defines a `...Command` or `...Query` type for a business-logic entry point
- defines the fields of an entry-point input type
- passes a domain entity or domain aggregate as a field of a command or query type
- uses a complex domain object where a primitive or basic type would suffice

## Allowed Input Types

The following types are allowed as fields in command and query types:

- **Strings**: `string`, `str`, `String`
- **Numbers**: `number`, `int`, `float`, `Int`, `Long`, `Double`
- **Booleans**: `boolean`, `bool`, `Boolean`
- **Collections of the above**: arrays or lists of any of the allowed types (e.g., `string[]`, `list[str]`)
- **Nested plain data structures**: types composed exclusively of the allowed types above, used to group related input fields (e.g., an `AddressInput` with `street: string`, `city: string`, `zipCode: string`)

## Forbidden Input Types

The following types must not appear as fields in command or query types:

- Domain entities (e.g., `Customer`, `Order`, `Subscription`)
- Domain aggregates
- Value objects that encapsulate behavior or enforce invariants
- Branded or opaque primitive types (e.g., `CustomerId`, `OrderId`, `RequesterId`, `Email`) — use the underlying primitive instead (e.g., `string`)
- Dates and temporal types (e.g., `Date`, `ZonedDateTime`, `Instant`, `LocalDate`, `datetime`) — use `string` in ISO 8601 format instead
- Enums (e.g., `CarClass`, `OrderStatus`) — use `string` instead
- Persistence-layer types (e.g., ORM entities, database records)
- Any type that requires the caller to construct a domain object before calling the entry point

## The Rule

1. Every field in a command or query type must be a primitive or basic type.
   - Use `string`, not `Customer` or `CustomerId`.
   - Use `string`, not `OrderStatus` or `CarClass` — represent enum values as strings.
   - Use `string` in ISO 8601 format, not `ZonedDateTime`, `Instant`, or `Date`.
   - Use `OrderLineDraft[]` (a plain data structure of primitives) not `OrderLine[]` if `OrderLine` is a domain entity.

2. The entry point is responsible for constructing or loading domain entities.
   - The entry point receives primitive input, then creates new domain entities or loads existing ones from a repository.
   - The caller does not need to know how domain entities are structured or instantiated.

3. Nested input structures must also contain only allowed types.
   - If a command field is a nested object, every field in that nested object must also be a primitive or basic type.
   - Do not smuggle domain entities or branded types inside nested input structures.

## Detection Workflow

1. Find command and query types.
   - Identify `...Command` and `...Query` types used by business-logic entry points.

2. Inspect each field.
   - Check whether the field type is a string, number, boolean, or a collection of these.
   - Flag any field whose type is a domain entity, domain aggregate, value object, branded/opaque primitive type, enum, or temporal type.

3. Check nested structures.
   - If a field is a nested object type, verify that all of its fields are also allowed types.

4. Trace the domain entity construction.
   - Verify that domain entities are constructed or loaded inside the entry point, not received as input.

## Writing or Changing Input Types

1. Start from the data the caller provides.
   - Identify what raw data the caller has: IDs as strings, numbers, booleans, dates as ISO 8601 strings, enum values as strings.
   - Express each piece of input data as a string, number, or boolean.

2. Use raw primitives for all values.
   - Use `string` for entity IDs, email addresses, dates (ISO 8601), enum values, and other values that may have domain-specific types in the domain layer.
   - Use `number` for quantities, amounts, and numeric values.
   - Use `boolean` for flags and binary choices.
   - The entry point is the boundary where raw primitives enter and domain types begin.

3. Use plain data structures for grouped input.
   - When multiple related values travel together (e.g., address fields), define a plain input structure with only allowed types.
   - Name these structures to reflect their input purpose (e.g., `AddressInput`, `OrderLineDraft`).

4. Let the entry point build domain objects.
   - Construct new domain entities from the primitive input inside the entry point.
   - Load existing domain entities from repositories using the provided IDs.

## Examples

Use this:

```ts
type CreateOrderCommand = {
  requesterId: string
  customerId: string
  lines: OrderLineDraft[]
}

type OrderLineDraft = {
  productId: string
  quantity: number
}
```

Not this:

```ts
type CreateOrderCommand = {
  requesterId: RequesterId
  customerId: CustomerId
  lines: OrderLine[]
}
```

Use this:

```py
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class CreateOrderCommand:
    requester_id: str
    customer_id: str
    lines: list[OrderLineDraft]

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class OrderLineDraft:
    product_id: str
    quantity: int
```

Not this:

```py
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class CreateOrderCommand:
    requester_id: RequesterId
    customer_id: CustomerId
    lines: list[OrderLine]
```

Use this:

```kt
data class CreateOrderCommand(
    val requesterId: String,
    val customerId: String,
    val lines: List<OrderLineDraft>,
)

data class OrderLineDraft(
    val productId: String,
    val quantity: Int,
)
```

Not this:

```kt
data class CreateOrderCommand(
    val requesterId: RequesterId,
    val customerId: CustomerId,
    val lines: List<OrderLine>,
)
```

## Review Questions

When reading or reviewing code, ask:

- Are all fields in this command or query type strings, numbers, booleans, or collections of these?
- Does any field use a domain-entity type, domain aggregate, value object, branded/opaque primitive type, enum, or temporal type?
- Are nested input structures composed exclusively of allowed types?
- Is the entry point responsible for constructing or loading domain entities from the primitive input?
- Does the caller need to build a domain entity before calling this entry point?

If any input field uses a forbidden type, apply this standard.

## Report the Outcome

When finishing the task:

- state which command or query types were identified or changed
- state which fields were changed from domain or branded types to raw primitive types
- state which nested input structures were introduced or corrected
- state how domain-entity construction was moved inside the entry point
