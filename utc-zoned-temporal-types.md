# UTC Zoned Temporal Types

## Goal

When the stack supports timezone-aware built-in or standard-library temporal types, use those types and set their timezone to UTC.

Treat this standard as normalization guidance for timezone-aware temporal values. The key question is whether the code can use a built-in temporal type that carries timezone semantics. If it can, represent the value in UTC instead of server-local time, user-local time, or an arbitrary geographic timezone.

## What Counts as In Scope

Apply this standard to code that does one or more of these things:

- defines timezone-aware datetime or timestamp fields
- defines temporal parameters or return types that can carry timezone information
- parses or serializes timezone-aware temporal values
- maps timezone-aware values to persistence or transport boundaries
- converts between local time and a normalized stored or exchanged value
- configures default timezones for timezone-aware temporal types

## UTC Rule

1. Use timezone-aware built-in temporal types when the stack provides them.
   - Prefer the native or standard-library temporal type that can carry timezone semantics.
   - Do not fall back to naive local datetimes when a timezone-aware built-in type is available.

2. Use UTC as the timezone.
   - Use the canonical UTC representation provided by the language or standard library.
   - Prefer named UTC constructs such as `UTC`, `Z`, or the standard-library UTC zone object over ad hoc local timezone settings.

3. Normalize at boundaries.
   - Convert external or local values to UTC as they enter the system when the task requires a timezone-aware built-in type.
   - Serialize or persist the normalized UTC value unless the boundary contract explicitly requires another representation.

4. Keep UTC semantics explicit.
   - Make it obvious in types, constructors, helpers, and serialization code that the value is timezone-aware and normalized to UTC.
   - Do not rely on server defaults, process defaults, database session defaults, or ambient local timezone configuration.

## Detection Workflow

1. Determine whether the value can be timezone-aware.
   - Identify whether the field, parameter, or contract represents a datetime or timestamp that the stack can model with a timezone-aware built-in type.
   - Ignore date-only and time-only values that do not carry timezone semantics.

2. Detect built-in timezone-aware support in the stack.
   - Identify the native or standard-library temporal types that support timezone-aware values.
   - Follow the project's established conventions for constructing, storing, and serializing those types.

3. Trace normalization points.
   - Identify where values enter the system from user input, APIs, databases, jobs, or integrations.
   - Identify where local or offset-based inputs must be converted into UTC.
   - Verify that later reads, writes, and comparisons keep the value in UTC.

## Writing or Changing Temporal Code

1. Prefer timezone-aware built-in types over naive ones.
   - Use the built-in timezone-aware temporal type when the stack supports it.
   - Avoid storing the same concept as a naive local datetime plus an implicit timezone assumption.

2. Set or construct values in UTC.
   - Use the standard UTC zone, UTC clock, or UTC constructor path provided by the stack.
   - Avoid local-now helpers or system-default timezone constructors when a UTC alternative exists.

3. Convert only at the edges when needed.
   - Convert from user-facing or boundary-specific representations into UTC near the boundary.
   - Keep the internal timezone-aware representation in UTC once normalized.

4. Keep serialization and persistence aligned.
   - Persist or emit timezone-aware values in a UTC-safe format.
   - Preserve the fact that the stored or exchanged value is UTC.

## Review Questions

When reading or reviewing code, ask:

- Can this value be represented with a built-in timezone-aware temporal type?
- If so, is the code using that type instead of a naive local datetime?
- Is the timezone explicitly UTC?
- Is the code relying on server-local or process-default timezone behavior instead of UTC?
- Would changing this code risk losing UTC normalization for timezone-aware values?

If the answer is yes, apply this standard.

## Report the Outcome

When finishing the task:

- state which timezone-aware temporal values or types were identified or changed
- state which built-in or standard-library timezone-aware types were used
- state where UTC construction, normalization, serialization, or persistence was implemented or preserved
